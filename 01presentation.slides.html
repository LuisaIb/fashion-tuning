/*
The following CSS variables define the main, public API for styling JupyterLab.
These variables should be used by all plugins wherever possible. In other
words, plugins should not define custom colors, sizes, etc unless absolutely
necessary. This enables users to change the visual theme of JupyterLab
by changing these variables.

Many variables appear in an ordered sequence (0,1,2,3). These sequences
are designed to work well together, so for example, `--jp-border-color1` should
be used with `--jp-layout-color1`. The numbers have the following meanings:

* 0: super-primary, reserved for special emphasis
* 1: primary, most important under normal situations
* 2: secondary, next most important under normal situations
* 3: tertiary, next most important under normal situations

Throughout JupyterLab, we are mostly following principles from Google's
Material Design when selecting colors. We are not, however, following
all of MD as it is not optimized for dense, information rich UIs.

<p style="color: #ff6900; font-weight: bold; font-size: 25px;">Why was the Fashion-MNIST dataset created?</p>
<span style="text-align: right; font-size: 12px;">Isabel Janez</span>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Original MNIST dataset: handwritten digits</li>
<li>MNIST is often used as benchmark to validate algorithms</li>
<li>MNIST is too easy, overused and can not represent modern Computer Vision tasks</li>
<li>Fashion-MNIST intended to serve as a direct drop-in replacement, sharing same images size and the structure of training and testing splits</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p style="color: #ff6900; font-weight: bold; font-size: 25px;">The aim of Fashion-MNIST dataset</p>
<ul>
<li>Good benchmark dataset</li>
<li>Accessibility of MNIST: small size, straightforward encoding and permissive license</li>
<li>A more challenging classification task</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Uniform distribution sampling explores a broad range of values while Loguniform focuses on a range of learning rates that span multiple orders of magnitude <br/>→ beneficial as it's common in DL that values on a logarithmic scale work well</li>
<li>Uniform sampling helps to assess the sensitivity to specific learning rates, but is more resource-intensive compared to tuning with Loguniform</li>

</div>
<ul>
<li>Project shows the importance of fine-tuning for achieving better performance</li>
<li>Utilization of three distinct approaches - Random Search, Hyperband, and SMBO</li>
<li>Fashion-MNIST is a valuable benchmark dataset</li>
<li>learning_rate is a very sensitive hyperparameter</li>
<li>The kind of sampling for the hyperparameter plays a role</li>
<li>Mostly no general accepted default hyperparameters for DNNs</li>
<li>Risk of Overfitting</li>
</ul>
